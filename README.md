# Acacia's README

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by... 

### What is this? 

This document is a constant work in progress. The purpose of this document is not to replace getting to know me but rather to accelarate your understanding of who I am and how I work.

### My Philosophy
... or, _mantras I live by_

To start, here are some principles I live by to help you better understand me as a human being and a person. 

**Clarity is power.** We can't do everything, we can't be everyone. We are one person living right now in this moment. Get clarity about who you are and what you want to accomplish in this very short time you are alive. Get clarity about what you will and will not do; what you will or will not allow; who you want to be and who you are becoming. 

**Do what scares you.** Be bold. Seek discomfort. Do what scares you. (It probably is not as scary as you imagine!). This is how we grow. We can accomplish so much more than we think if we take big bets, reach for audacious goals, and maintain a growth mindset when we fail. Our life is formed by how we focus our attention and what chose to spend time doing. Most things can be learned and achieved as a function of time, effort, and a willingness to try again.

**We find our meaning in service to others.** Be generous. Give away what you have. An old Georgian proverb says what is given away is kept forever, but what is kept is lost forever. Meaning, purpose, and significance is found in service to others. I believe a life well-lived is a life that is given away in service to others.

**Own it.** Taking ownership is the secret sauce to having an impact. I believe in order to get a job done, you have to be willing to take a (sometimes seemingly) irrational amount of responsibility for outcomes. Only then will you see the part you play and make necessary adjustments to achieve results.

**Actions speak louder than words.** Validate everything. Look at the data. Be vigilant. Studies have shown our minds make up stories (lie) to us all the time, we are far less rational than we think we are. For this reason, I have a general distrust of my own thinking and what people say. If you want to understand yourself, a person, organization, nation, look beyond what they say to see what they do.

### Working with me

#### What you can expect
- I will give my best in everything I do
- I will work hard, I will rest when I need to
- I'm always learning, always growing
- I won't accept the status quo, I am always asking "is this the best way?"
- I will be honest, I will be clear

#### What I expect of you
- Define what success looks like
- Don't withhold feedback when I am not meeting the mark

### Balancing life and work

My vision for my life and the impact I want to have is not limitted to my work contributions. I am accountable to resposibilities, communities, people and purpose beyond my 9-5. Striking a balance is important to avoid burning out. I achieve this by allocating time to rest and live well outside of work. Here are a few things I generally do not do in order to protect this balance: 
- Use email or Slack off-hours
- Work weekends
- Schedule meetings very late in the day

There are some excpetions to this such as on-call rotations, hackathons, and incidents scoped to my domain expertise. Otherwise, I hold this line so that I can bring my best self to work during the hours I am accountable to work. 

### Communication and collaborating 

I work remote so this is within the context of working on a distrubuted team. In general, on a team, the goal is to find the most expediant mode of communication to move the work/project forward. Use your discretion and I will always be willing and open to work with you in whatever way is needed to get the job done. That being said, here are my preferences: 

#### Meetings 
I'm a planner and as an engineer I like to protect my time for deep work to get into flow and spend my attention on complex problem solving. If a meeting can be asynchronous and/or replaced with a Slack message/exchange or email, then do that. If you find the issue/problem/topic too large, amorpheous, or complex for a Slack exchange, then Slack DM me for an ad hoc sync (Slack huddle, Zoom, etc.)

**Dos:**
- Do schedule ahead of time
- Do share context ahead of time: context switching is cognitively costly so please help me by sharing any context in the form of documents, agenda, etc. ahead of time. 
- Do be clear about the goal of the meeting and what we are trying to achieve: have an agenda, state the goal of the meeting at the beginning of our time together

**Don'ts:**
- Do not expect me to show up to a scheduled meeting if I have not accepted the invite

#### Slack
Generally, Slack is the easiest way to get in touch with me. I try to stay on top of Slack and respond in less than an hour during the workday. One exception is meetings. I don't multi-task, I typically catch up on Slack between meetings. There are times when I get deep into debugging or flow and may not respond for an extended amount of time, if this is the case, I will usually say so. 

#### Email
I'm quite averse to it and try to spend as little time as possible dealing with it. Typically, I'll lump my email processing into a morning session or an afternoon session. However, if the day is full, this can slip. When something is urgent, please do not use email or we're both going to have a sad time.

#### Pager Duty
If it's off-hours and urgent, please page me. If pager duty is not set up, call/text me. 

#### Mobile
For my friends and family. If Pager Duty is not an option, then text/call for incidents and emergencies. I have the Slack app on my phone and use it frequently so a DM there should be as good as a text.  

#### Social Media
Nope. 

### Bugs and Quirks 
Like most humans, I come equipped with a handful of flaws and personality traits that you may find challenging. There are ways in which I try to control or compensate for each of these tendencies but I'm not always successful. My hope is that by being open about these aspects of my personality you will feel comfortable calling them out if they become a problem for you.

### My Story

[todo -- alternate doc]

### Passions and Interests

I believe that we perform best when we believe in what we are doing. I find bottomless wells of energy and motivation when the work I'm doing alligns with who I am and the impact I want to ultimately have in this lifetime. We do not have a lot of time on this earth. Our time is our most precious resouce. I aim to spend it wisely on things that matter most.
- creating empowering spaces where people feel like they belong, take risks, and do their best work 
- empowering the under-priveledged and under-resourced through education --> WomenWhoCode, GirlsWhoCode, etc. 
- disrupting education and other longstanding and out-dated institutions by providing solutions that work

For fun, I love to spend time outdoors and enjoy anything that involves a controlled fall: I ski, surf, sail, and dance. Cooking and gardening are ways I love to stay connected to our wonderful mother earth. My immediate family is important to me and I take my role as an Auntie very seriously.
