# Acacia's README

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by... 

### About me

These are some things I have learned about myself over the years that influence what I do, how I work, and what it's like to work with me. This document captures these things. The goal of this document is to help you get to know me, but it does not replace getting to know me. Nothing replaces time tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte or rolling up our sleeves and working together ðŸ˜€

I believe that we perform best when we believe in what we do. I find bottomless wells of energy and motivation when the work I'm doing alligns with the impact I want to ultimately have in this lifetime. We really do not have a lot of time on this earth. Our time is our most precious resouce. I aim to spend my time wisely on things that matter most. 

#### Missions I care about 
- creating inclusive spaces where people feel like they belong, take risks, and do their best work --> every team I am part of
- empowering the under-priveledged and under-resourced through education --> WomenWhoCode, GirlsWhoCode, etc. 
- slowing and reversing climate change --> minimizing personal consumption, building and/or supporting scalable solutions for change

### Core Values 
... or, _mantras I live by_

Clarity is power. [todo: explain]

Do what scares you. [todo: explain]

We find our meaning in service to others. [todo: explain]

Actions speak louder than words. [todo: explain]

We are all WIP. 

### What I'm up to... 

Winter 2022/2023, I have been
- Reading books I've been wanting to read, like Code Complete and Programming Pearls. More on that [here](https://millennialbasic.com/reading-list/). 
- Studying Data Structures, Algorithms, and System Design. More on that [here](https://github.com/xacaciax/js-ds-and-algos).
- Reflecting on my past two roles as a software engineer and asking myself what I want next... 

Spring 2023, I'm actively applying to jobs and interviewing. In my next role, I aim to
- have opportunities to continue leading full stack projects start to finish
- be a part of a culture of experimentation and making data-driven product decisions
- work with kind engineers who are committed to engineering excellence, on a fully dispersed team

If you think I'd make a good addition to your team, or you just want to connect, I love meeting new people! Don't hesitate to reach out [here](https://millennialbasic.com/contact/).
