# Acacia's README

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by... 

### What is this? 

These are some things I have learned about myself over the years that influence what I do, how I work, and what it's like to work with me. This document captures these things. The goal of this document is to help you get to know me, but it does not replace getting to know me. Nothing replaces time tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte or rolling up our sleeves and working together ðŸ˜€ 

### My Philosophy
... or, _mantras I live by_

Clarity is power. [todo: explain]

Do what scares you. [todo: explain]

We find our meaning in service to others. [todo: explain]

Actions speak louder than words. [todo: explain]

We are all WIP. 

### Working with me

- I will give my best in everything I do
- Always learning, always growing
- I will not withhold feedback 
- I won't accept the status quo

#### What I expect of you

### Communicating with me

[WIP]

### Bugs and Quirks

### My Story

### Personal Interests

I believe that we perform best when we believe in what we are doing. I find bottomless wells of energy and motivation when the work I'm doing alligns with who I am and the impact I want to ultimately have in this lifetime. We do not have a lot of time on this earth. Our time is our most precious resouce. I aim to spend it wisely on things that matter most.

### What I'm up to... 

Winter 2022/2023, I have been
- Studying Data Structures, Algorithms, and System Design. More on that [here](https://github.com/xacaciax/js-ds-and-algos).
- Reading books I've been wanting to read, like Code Complete and Programming Pearls. More on that [here](https://millennialbasic.com/reading-list/). 
- Reflecting on my past two roles as a software engineer and asking myself what I want next... 

Spring 2023, I'm actively applying to jobs and interviewing. In my next role, I aim to
- have opportunities to continue leading full stack projects start to finish
- be a part of a culture of experimentation and making data-driven product decisions
- work with kind engineers who are committed to engineering excellence, on a fully dispersed team

If you think I'd make a good addition to your team, or you just want to connect, I love meeting new people! Don't hesitate to reach out [here](https://millennialbasic.com/contact/).
