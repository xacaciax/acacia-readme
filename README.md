# Acacia's README

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by... 

### What is this? 

These are some things I have learned about myself over the years about who I am and what it's like to work with me.

### My Philosophy
... or, _mantras I live by_

Clarity is power. [todo: explain]

Do what scares you. [todo: explain]

We find our meaning in service to others. [todo: explain]

Actions speak louder than words. [todo: explain]

We are all WIP. 

### Working with me

#### What you can expect
- I will give my best in everything I do
- I'm always learning, always growing
- I won't accept the status quo 

#### What I expect of you
- Define what success looks like
- Don't withhold feedback 

### Bugs and Quirks
- Big dreams, little engine
- Missing context and it's affects
- Intuitive connections and deductive reasoning
- Impostor syndrome

### My Story

[todo -- alternate doc]

### Personal Interests

I believe that we perform best when we believe in what we are doing. I find bottomless wells of energy and motivation when the work I'm doing alligns with who I am and the impact I want to ultimately have in this lifetime. We do not have a lot of time on this earth. Our time is our most precious resouce. I aim to spend it wisely on things that matter most.
- creating inclusive spaces where people feel like they belong, take risks, and do their best work --> every team I am part of
- empowering the under-priveledged and under-resourced through education --> WomenWhoCode, GirlsWhoCode, etc. 
- slowing and reversing climate change --> minimizing personal consumption, building and/or supporting scalable solutions for change
- disrupting education and other longstanding and out-dated institutions

### What I'm up to... 

Winter 2022/2023, I have been
- Studying Data Structures, Algorithms, and System Design. More on that [here](https://github.com/xacaciax/js-ds-and-algos).
- Reading books I've been wanting to read, like Code Complete and Programming Pearls. More on that [here](https://millennialbasic.com/reading-list/). 
- Reflecting on my past two roles as a software engineer and asking myself what I want next... 

Spring 2023, I'm actively applying to jobs and interviewing. In my next role, I aim to
- have opportunities to continue leading full stack projects start to finish
- be a part of a culture of experimentation and making data-driven product decisions
- work with kind engineers who are committed to engineering excellence, on a fully dispersed team

If you think I'd make a good addition to your team, or you just want to connect, I love meeting new people! Don't hesitate to reach out [here](https://millennialbasic.com/contact/).
